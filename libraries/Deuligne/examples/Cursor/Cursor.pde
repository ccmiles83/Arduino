based on official arduino LiquidCrystal Library
 - Cursor
 
 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The LiquidCrystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the 
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.
 
 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD and
 uses the cursor()  and noCursor() methods to turn
 on and off the cursor.
